### What I learned

Learn about using svg for the background using css. How to add it to html as an image and styling it with css.
Also learn to do mobile first workflow.

```css
.bg{
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    background-image: url(./images/pattern-background-desktop.svg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: 100%;
    background-position: 0rem -5rem;
    background-color: hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
}
```
